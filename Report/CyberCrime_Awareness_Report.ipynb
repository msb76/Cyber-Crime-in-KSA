    "Cyber crime cases are drastically increasing in Saudi Arabia. At present, Saudi Arabia is one of the top 10 countries in significant cyber attacks.[1] These cyber attacks lead to serious damages for individuals, companies and governments. *See infographic below.[2]* In order to reduce these cyber attacks and minimize their damages, the project will identify awareness measures of Saudi people about the danger of cyber crimes and will find out the major factors for becoming a potential victim. After identifying the factors, a model will be created to predict if a person will become a victim of cyber crime or not. \n",

    " - In insight 1, it is approved that the more security apps the user uses, the less probability of becoming a victim. So number of security apps used considered a major factor.\n",
    " - In insight 2, phishing emails and malwares have high occurance in Saudi Arabia.\n",
    " - In insight 3, victims indictes they're mostly using the internet to browse Social Network platforms \n",
    " - In insight 4, 71.3% of victims claims they are following a good practices to be safe from cyber attacks/threats, however, they are still being affected by them.\n",
    " - In insight 5, 44% of respondents claims they are victims and they don’t know if they’re been exposed to a cybercrime or not.\n",
    " - In insight 6, we can see the majority of victims see themselves as very secure towards cybercrimes\n",
    " - In insight 7, two pie charts presents a conflicting information gathered from victims. In the first chart, 84.9% of victims avoid disclosing their personal information, however, in the second chart shows that 51% of these people actually do share their information in the internet.\n",
    " - In insight 8, 23.3% keep themselves educated from online resources, however, 21.2% doesn’t keep themselves updated about cybercrimes which indicates a huge issue.\n",
    " - In insight 9, respondents see that it is a shared responsibility for the government, education systems, media, eservice companies and the user itselves to raise the awareness about cybercrimes.\n",

Beating the baseline model in the start was a rough process but after removing the specified records and decreasing the bias in the dataset now the data classes gap minimized which makes more sense."

    "As years pass, cybercrime increases and it will always be a huge case that each individual should be educated on. This report discussed cybercrimes’ victim behaviors, awareness and understandings about security practices. The dataset used is a questionnaire. The cleaning process turned the questionnaire answers into a more suitable data format to be used in EDA and modeling. The EDA part  discusses and proves cybercrimes lack of awareness. In the modeling part, the Random Forest model performs the best to identify if a person would be a victim or not based on certain factors.\n",
